//! BUG: [A301212-88] If delete() fails, user info in firestore is still deleted. Can solve with a dedicated reauthenticate.

//! If the user clicks the email link asking to revert email change, profile and auth emails are out of sync, i.e., profile email is not reverted.

//! Known issue with react-redux-firebase: https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase/issues/859
