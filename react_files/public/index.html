            content="We help users share rent, share goods, and separate finances in a way that mathematically guarantees no person will feel envy towards someone else.
            This is done by using fair division and rental harmony algorithms that are made to solve sharing problems, i.e., split goods between people in a way that doesn’t cause resentment.
            The algorithms take everyone’s monetary valuations and compute an allocation which result in no one feeling envy towards someone else. Additionally, these algorithms result in a pareto-efficient situation, where no one would be better of without making at least 1 other person worse of.
            Multiple harmony algorithms are included for each sharing case.
            Users can share their rent, indivisible goods, and their finances, which can include both indivisible goods and money.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
